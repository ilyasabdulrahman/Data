reasonable quality assurance activities; (b) it has performed any reasonable testing; and (c) it has corrected all 
material deficiencies discovered during the quality assurance activities and testing.  To the extent that testing 
occurs at State Locations, the State is entitled to observe and otherwise participate in the testing.

shipper's delivery document(s) and appropriate procedures to record the damage.    
 
2.8.3 Process for Acceptance of Deliverable(s) 
The State's review period for acceptance of the Deliverable(s) is governed by the applicable Statement of 
Work, the State will review within 3 business days of items received.  The State will notify the Contractor by the 
end of the State Review Period that either: 
(a)  the Deliverable is accepted in the form delivered by the Contractor; 
(b)  the Deliverable is accepted, but noted deficiencies must be corrected; or 
(c)  the Deliverable is rejected along with notation of any deficiencies that must be corrected before 
acceptance of the Deliverable. 
 
If the State delivers to the Contractor a notice of deficiencies, the Contractor will correct the described 
deficiencies and within 30 Days resubmit the Deliverable(s) with an explanation that demonstrates all 
corrections have been made to the original Deliverable(s).  The Contractor's correction efforts will be made at 
no additional charge.  Upon receipt of a corrected Deliverable from the Contractor, the State will have a 
reasonable additional period of time, not to exceed 30 Days, to accept the corrected Deliverable. 
 
2.8.4 Acceptance of Deliverable(s) 
(a)  The State's obligation to comply with any State Review Period is conditioned on the timely delivery 
of the Deliverable(s).  The State Review Period will begin on the first Business Day following the State's receipt 
of the Deliverable(s).

(b)  The State may inspect the Deliverable to confirm that all components have been delivered without 
material deficiencies.  If the State determines that the Deliverable or one of its components has material 
deficiencies, the State may reject the Deliverable without performing any further inspection or testing.   
(c)  The State will only approve a Deliverable after confirming that it conforms to and performs 
according to its specifications without material deficiency.  The State may, in its discretion, conditionally 
approve a Deliverable that contains material deficiencies if the State elects to permit the Contractor to correct 
those deficiencies post-approval.  The Contractor remains responsible for working diligently to correct, within a 
reasonable time at the Contractor's expense, all deficiencies in the Deliverable that remain outstanding at the 
time of State approval. 
(d)  If, after three opportunities the Contractor is unable to correct all deficiencies, the State may: (i) 
demand that the Contractor cure the failure and give the Contractor additional time to do so at the sole 
expense of the Contractor; (ii) keep this Contract in force and perform, either itself or through other parties, 
whatever the Contractor has failed to do, and recover the difference between the cost to cure the deficiency 
and these Contract price plus an additional amount equal to 10% of the State's cost to cure the deficiency; or 
(iii) fully or partially terminate this Contract for default by giving notice to the Contractor.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the State cannot use, as a basis for exercising its termination rights under this Section, deficiencies 
discovered in a repeat State Review Period that could reasonably have been discovered during a prior State 
Review Period.   
(e)  The State, at any time and in its reasonable discretion, may reject the Deliverable without notation 
of all deficiencies if the acceptance process reveals deficiencies in a sufficient quantity or of a sufficient 
severity that renders continuing the process unproductive or unworkable.

commissions, officers, employees, and agents.   
(a)  The following apply to all insurance requirements: 
(i)  The State, in its sole discretion, may approve the use of a fully-funded self-insurance program in 
place of any specified insurance identified in this Section. 
(ii)  Where specific coverage limits are listed in this Section, they represent the minimum acceptable 
limits.  If the Contractor's policy contains higher limits, the State is entitled to coverage to the extent of 
the higher limits.  The minimum limits of coverage specified are not intended, and may not be construed 
to limit any liability or indemnity of the Contractor to any indemnified party or other persons.   
(iii)  If the Contractor fails to pay any premium for a required insurance policy, or if any insurer cancels 
or significantly reduces any required insurance without the State's approval, the State may, after giving 
the Contractor at least 30 days’ notice, pay the premium or procure similar insurance coverage from 
another company or companies.  The State may deduct any part of the cost from any payment due the 
Contractor, or require the Contractor to pay that cost upon demand. 
(iv)  In the event the State approves the representation of the State by the insurer's attorney, the 
attorney may be required to be designated as a Special Assistant Attorney General by the Michigan 
Attorney General.

indirectly employed by the Contractor or a Subcontractor, or any person for whose acts the Contractor 
or a Subcontractor may be liable.   
(ii)  waive all rights against the State for the recovery of damages that are covered by the insurance 
policies the Contractor is required to maintain under this Section.  The Contractor's failure to obtain and

to any comparable liability insurance (including self-insurance) carried by the State. 
(iv)  obtain insurance, unless the State approves otherwise, from any insurer that has an A.M. Best

liability, including all claims and losses, and all related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' 
fees and costs of investigation, litigation, settlement, judgments, interest and penalties), accruing or resulting to

Contract and that are attributable to the negligence or tortious acts of the Contractor, any of its subcontractors, 
or by anyone else for whose acts any of them may be liable. 
 
2.15.2 Code Indemnification - Deleted - Not Applicable 
 
2.15.3 Employee Indemnification 
In any claims against the State, its departments, agencies, commissions, officers, employees, and agents, by

any way by the amount or type of damages, compensation, or benefits payable by or for the Contractor or any 
of its subcontractors under worker's disability compensation acts, disability benefit acts, or other employee 
benefit acts.  This indemnification clause is intended to be comprehensive.  Any overlap in provisions, or the 
fact that greater specificity is provided as to some categories of risk, is not intended to limit the scope of 
indemnification under any other provisions. 
 
2.15.4 Patent/Copyright Infringement Indemnification 
(a)  To the extent permitted by law, the Contractor must indemnify and hold the State harmless from 
liability, including all claims and losses, and all related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' 
fees and costs of investigation, litigation, settlement, judgments, interest, and penalties) resulting from any 
action threatened or brought against the State to the extent that the action is based on a claim that any piece 
of equipment, software, commodity, or service supplied by the Contractor or its subcontractors, or its operation, 
use, or reproduction, infringes any United States patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret of any person or 
entity.   
(b)  If, in the State's or the Contractor's opinion, any piece of equipment, software, commodity or 
service supplied by the Contractor or its subcontractors, or its operation, use, or reproduction, is likely to 
become the subject of an infringement claim, the Contractor must, at its expense: (i) procure for the State the 
right to continue using the equipment, software, commodity or service or, if this option is not reasonably 
available to the Contractor; (ii) replace or modify to the State's satisfaction the same with equipment, software, 
commodity or service of equivalent function and performance so that it becomes non-infringing, or, if this option 
is not reasonably available to Contractor; (iii) accept its return by the State with appropriate credits to the State 
against the Contractor's charges and reimburse the State for any losses or costs incurred as a consequence of 
the State ceasing its use and returning it. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor has no obligation to indemnify or defend the State 
for, or to pay any costs, damages or attorneys' fees related to, any infringement claim based upon:  (i) 
equipment, software, commodity or service developed based on written specifications of the State; (ii) use of 
the equipment, software, or commodity in a configuration other than implemented or approved by the 
Contractor, including any modification of the same by the State; or (iii) the combination, operation, or use of the 
equipment, software, or commodity with equipment, software, or commodities not supplied by the Contractor 
under this Contract. 
 
2.15.5 Continuing Obligation 
The Contractor's duty to indemnify under Section 2.15, Indemnification, continues in full force and effect, 
notwithstanding the expiration or early cancellation of this Contract, with respect to any claims based on facts 
or conditions that occurred before expiration or cancellation. 
 
2.15.6 Indemnification Procedures 
These procedures apply to all indemnity obligations: 
(a)  After the State receives notice of an action or proceeding involving a claim for which it will seek 
indemnification, the State must promptly notify the Contractor of the claim and take, or assist the Contractor in 
taking, any reasonable action to avoid a default judgment against the Contractor.  Failure to notify the 
CONTRACT #071B3200062
 
 
30 
Contractor does not relieve the Contractor of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that the 
Contractor can prove damages attributable to the notification failure.  Within 10 days following receipt of notice 
from the State relating to any claim, the Contractor must notify the State whether the Contractor agrees to 
assume control of the defense and settlement of that claim (a "Notice of Election").  After notifying the 
Contractor of a claim and before the State receives the Contractor's Notice of Election, the State is entitled to 
defend against the claim, at the Contractor's expense, and the Contractor will be responsible for any 
reasonable costs, including attorney fees, incurred by the State in defending against the claim during that 
period. 
(b)  If the Contractor delivers a Notice of Election relating to any claim:  (i) the State is entitled to 
participate in the defense of the claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in handling the claim 
and to monitor and advise the State about the status and progress of the defense; (ii) the Contractor must, at 
the request of the State, demonstrate the Contractor's financial ability to carry out its defense and indemnity 
obligations under this Contract; (iii) the Contractor must periodically advise the State about the status and 
progress of the defense and must obtain prior approval of the State before entering into any settlement of the 
claim or ceasing to defend against the claim; and (iv) to the extent that any principles of Michigan 
governmental or public law may be involved or challenged, the State has the right, at its own expense, to 
control the defense of that portion of the claim.  The State may retain control of the defense and settlement of a 
claim by notifying the Contractor within 10 days after the State's receipt of the Contractor's information 
requested by the State under clause (ii) of this paragraph, if the State determines that the Contractor has failed 
to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the State the Contractor's financial ability to carry out its 
defense and indemnity obligations under this Section.  Any litigation activity on behalf of the State, or any of its 
subdivisions under this Section, must be coordinated with the Department of Attorney General.  In the event 
the insurer's attorney represents the State under this Section, the insurer's attorney may be required to be 
designated as a Special Assistant Attorney General by the Attorney General of the State of Michigan.   
(c)  If the Contractor does not deliver a Notice of Election relating to any claim of which it is notified, the

Termination by the State 
 
2.16.1 Notice and Right to Cure 
If the Contractor breaches this Contract, and the State, in its sole discretion, determines that the breach is 
curable, the State will provide the Contractor notice of the breach and a period of at least 30 days to cure the 
breach.  The State does not need to provide notice or an opportunity to cure for successive or repeated

property. 
 
2.16.2 Termination for Cause

(b)  If the State partially terminates this Contract for cause, any charges payable to the Contractor will 
be equitably adjusted to reflect those Deliverable(s) that are terminated.  The State must pay for all

31 
(c)  If the State terminates this Contract for cause and it is determined, for any reason, that the 
Contractor was not in breach of this Contract, the termination will be deemed to have been a termination under

the parties will be limited to those provided in that Section. 
 
2.16.3 Termination for Convenience 
The State may fully or partially terminate this Contract for its convenience if the State determines that a 
termination is in the State's best interest.  Reasons for the termination are within the sole discretion of the 
State and may include: (a) the State no longer needs the Deliverable(s) specified in this Contract; (b) a 
relocation of office, program changes, or changes in laws, rules, or regulations make the Deliverable(s) no 
longer practical or feasible for the State; (c) unacceptable prices for Contract changes; or (d) falsification or 
misrepresentation, by inclusion or non-inclusion, of information material to a response to any ITB issued by the 
State.  The State may terminate this Contract for its convenience by giving Contractor notice at least 30 days 
before the date of termination.  If the State chooses to terminate this Contract in part, any charges payable to 
the Contractor must be equitably adjusted to reflect those Deliverable(s) that are terminated. 
 
2.16.4 Termination for Non-Appropriation 
(a)  If this Contract extends for more than one fiscal year, continuation of this Contract is subject to the 
appropriation or availability of funds.  If sufficient funds to enable the State to continue payment are not 
appropriated or otherwise made available, the State must fully or partially terminate this Contract at the end of 
the last period for which funds have been appropriated or otherwise made available   The State must give the 
Contractor notice at least 30 days before the date of termination, unless the State receives notice of the non-
appropriation or unavailability less than 30 days before the end of the last period for which funds have been 
appropriated or otherwise made available. 
(b)  If funding for this Contract is reduced by law, or funds to pay the Contractor for the Deliverable(s) 
are not appropriated or are otherwise unavailable, the State may, upon 30 days notice to the Contractor, 
change the Deliverable(s) in the manner and for the periods of time the State may elect.  The charges payable 
under this Contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any Deliverable(s) not provided because of the 
reduction. 
(c)  If the State fully or partially terminates this Contract for non-appropriation, the State must pay the 
Contractor for all work-in-progress performed through the effective date of the termination to the extent funds 
are available.   
 
2.16.5 Termination for Criminal Conviction 
The State may terminate this Contract immediately and without further liability or penalty if the Contractor, an

offense related to a State, public, or private Contract or subcontract. 
 
2.16.6 Termination for Approvals Rescinded 
The State may terminate this Contract if any final administrative or judicial decision or adjudication disapproves 
a previously approved request for purchase of personal services under Constitution 1963, Article 11, § 5, and 
Civil Service Rule 7-1.  In that case, the State will pay the Contractor for all work-in-progress performed 
through the effective date of the termination.  The Contract may be fully or partially terminated and will be 
effective as of the date stated in the notice.

(iii)  return all materials and property provided directly or indirectly to the Contractor by any 
entity, agent, or employee of the State;  
(iv)  transfer title in and deliver to the State, unless otherwise directed, all Deliverable(s)

applicable, as a separate item of payment, for work-in-progress, based on a percentage of completion 
determined by the State.  All completed or partially completed Deliverable(s) prepared by the Contractor, at the 
option of the State, become the State's property, and the Contractor is entitled to receive equitable 
compensation for those Deliverable(s).  Regardless of the basis for the termination, the State is not obligated 
to pay or otherwise compensate the Contractor for any lost expected future profits, costs, or expenses incurred 
with respect to Deliverable(s) not actually completed. 
(c)  If the State terminates this Contract for any reason, the State may assume, at its option, any

documentation during such transition period.

days) to cure the breach.   
 
The Contractor may terminate this Contract if the State:  (a) materially breaches its obligation to pay the 
Contractor undisputed amounts due; (b) breaches its other obligations to an extent that makes it impossible or 
commercially impractical for the Contractor to complete the Deliverable(s); or (c) does not cure the breach

CONTRACT #071B3200062
 
 
33 
2.18.2 Termination of Stop Work Order  
The Contractor must resume work if the State terminates a Stop Work Order or if it expires.  The parties will 
agree upon an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule, the Contract price, or both, and this Contract 
must be modified, if: (a) the Stop Work Order results in an increase in the time required for, or the Contractor's 
costs properly allocated to, the performance of this Contract; and (b) the Contractor asserts its right to an 
equitable adjustment within 20 days after the end of the Stop Work Order by submission of a request for 
adjustment to the State; provided that, the State may receive and act upon the Contractor's request submitted 
at any time before final payment.  Any adjustment will conform to the requirements of Section 2.3.4, Contract 
Changes. 
 
2.18.3 Allowance of the Contractor's Costs  
If the State fully or partially terminates the work covered by the Stop Work Order, for reasons other than 
material breach, the termination is a termination for convenience under Section 2.16, Termination by the State, 
and the State will pay reasonable costs resulting from the Stop Work Order in arriving at the termination 
settlement.  The State is not liable to the Contractor for lost profits because of a Stop Work Order issued under

proceedings.

as agreed to by the parties, the Director of DTMB-Procurement will issue a written recommendation regarding 
settlement of the claim.  The Contractor must notify DTMB-Procurement within 21 days after the 
recommendation is issued whether the Contractor accepts or rejects the recommendation.  Acceptance by the 
Contractor constitutes the final resolution of the claim addressed in the recommendation, and the Contractor 
may not assert that claim in any future litigation or other proceeding between the parties. 
(c)  The recommendation of the Director of DTMB-Procurement is not admissible in any future litigation 
or other proceeding between the parties.  The conduct and statements made during the course of negotiations 
or dispute resolution under Section 2.20, Dispute Resolution, are subject to Michigan Rule of Evidence 408 
and are not admissible in any future litigation or other proceeding between the parties. 
(d)  This section will not be construed to prohibit either party from instituting formal proceedings to avoid 
the expiration of any applicable limitations period, to preserve a superior position with respect to other 
creditors, or under Section 2.20.3, Injunctive Relief. 
(e)  DTMB-Procurement will not mediate disputes between the Contractor and any other entity, except 
State agencies, concerning responsibility for performance of work.

Dispute Resolution, where a party makes a good faith determination that a breach of this Contract by the other 
party will result in damages so immediate, so large or severe, and so incapable of adequate redress that a 
temporary restraining order or other injunctive relief is the only adequate remedy.

the extent the claim precludes performance and without limiting either party's right to terminate this Contract as
